## Ideas:

### Linked Lists

- [MP3 Player](/Projects/MP3Player.js): Implement an MP3 player playlist that is capable of play, pause, stop, skip forward/ backward, add/ remove song, sort by artists/ album/ year, search by artists/ album/ year, etc.

### Hash Tables

- [Hash Table](http://cs.boisestate.edu/~jhyeh/cs321/cs321_fall18/lab3.pdf)

### Trees

- AVL Tree: Implement an AVL tree that stores words sorted based on alphabetical prefixes.
- [B-Tree](http://cs.boisestate.edu/~jhyeh/cs321/cs321_fall18/lab4.pdf)

### Complex Data Structure (Combinations)

- Chess: Implement a chess board that records that tracks the history of each board position using a hash table and a Linked List.

### Algorithms

- [Knight's Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour): The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 Ã— 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.
